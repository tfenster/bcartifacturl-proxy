# bcartifacturl-proxy

**Archive note:** As explained [here](https://tobiasfenster.io/discontinuation-of-the-bc-artifact-url-proxy), the main usage scenario for the BC artifact URL proxy is no longer relevant. Therefore, the backend has been shut down and this repo is archived. If anyone wants to continue this effort for whatever reason, please reach out.

Proxy for artifact URLs read by bccontainerhelper. You can run this on your own environment with the docker image tobiasfenster/bcaup or you can use the publicly available Azure Function https://bca-url-proxy.azurewebsites.net/bca-url/ e.g. like this: https://bca-url-proxy.azurewebsites.net/bca-url/sandbox/de/19


### Examples

| Get-BCArtifactUrl | Url |
| :-- | :-- |
| ```Get-BCArtifactUrl -type Sandbox``` | `https://bca-url-proxy.azurewebsites.net/bca-url/sandbox` |
| ```Get-BCArtifactUrl -select NextMajor -accept_insiderEula``` | `https://bca-url-proxy.azurewebsites.net/bca-url?select=nextmajor&accept_insiderEula` |

### Caching
When a call comes in, it first checks a cache to find out if that artifact URLs has previously been requested. If a valid entry is found, the URL from the cache is returned. If no valid entry is found, `Get-BcArtifactUrl` is called with the supplied parameters and the resulting URL is either returned as redirect or as text content the `DoNotRedirect=true` parameter is append to the url.

#### Cache Expiration
By default, only cache entries that are less than 1 hour old are returned. To extend this duration, add the cacheExpiration parameter to the URL. For instance, use `https://bca-url-proxy.azurewebsites.net/bca-url/sandbox/de?cacheExpiration=86400` to retrieve cache entries up to 24 hours old. The minimum value allowed is 900, which corresponds to 15 minutes.
